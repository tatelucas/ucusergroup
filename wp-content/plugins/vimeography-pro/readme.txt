== Installation ==

1. Upload `vimeography-pro.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Help! My theme doesn't look right! =

Okay, deep breath. More than likely, it is another plugin causing this issue. See if you can pinpoint which one by disabling your plugins, one by one, and really determining if you need it. If that task sounds daunting, try disabling plugins that are used for photo galleries, minifying scripts, widgets, or otherwise alter your blog's appearance.

= Why don’t you support YouTub/MetaHall/Flacker/PreschoolHumor? =

Like many other video professionals, we believe that Vimeo is a beautiful website complete with clean design, a supportive community and a straightforward API. This makes Vimeo a great choice for professional looking portfolios. Yes, there are other crummier sites that may also do the job, but that’s like forcing down chicken nuggets for dinner when you could be having baked scallops and a caprese appetizer. Vimeo only; enough said.

= How do I add my Vimeography gallery to a post or page? =

Easy! All you have to do is type `[vimeography id="#"]`, where `#` is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.

= Where do I find the ID number of my Vimeography gallery? =

Each gallery’s ID number is located next to the gallery’s title in the first column on the edit galleries page.

= Can I override my Vimeography gallery settings in the shortcode? =

Sure thing! You can define all of the properties found in the admin panel right in your shortcode as well. Try using one, any, or all of the following parameters:
`[vimeography id="3" theme="thumbs" featured="http://vimeo.com/28380190" source="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks" limit="60" cache="3600" width="600px"]`

= Can I add the Vimeography gallery to my theme’s sidebar/footer/header etc.? =

Yes, but you’ll need some PHP knowledge to do it! Open the file you want to add the gallery to, and type `<?php do_shortcode('[vimeography id="#"]'); ?>`, where `#` is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.

= Can I change the look of my Vimeography theme? =

Heck yeah! Use the appearance editor to change your theme's style so that it matches your site perfectly.
