Use email to login, register and retrieve password in WordPress.

== Description ==

Smart WP Login allows you to configure default WordPress Login, Registration or 
Password Reset system to work with email and not username. You can enable this
feature individually on Login, Registration or Retrieve Password. So you can make
only **Login using Email**, **Registration using Email** or **Retrieve Password
using Email**. 

= Features =
* Enables you to use email instead of username to login, register or retrieve 
password.
* Removes username field from WordPress login.
* Removes username field from WordPress registration.
* When using Login with Email, it changes the default WordPress login error and
doesn't show username in error message.
* You can also change login, registration and retrieve password related message.

= Note =
Smart WP Login generates username automatically. Please see our FAQ section to 
learn how it generates username.

== FAQ ==
= What happens to username? How does this plugin generates username? =

WordPress registration system requires a username while registering a new user.
Adhering to WP rules, Smart WP Login provides a username on behalf of user.
It assigns local part of email as username, ex: if user registers with 
demo#demo@example.com, its username would be demodemo (no special chars).

= What happens if username already exists? =

In case username already exists, system tries to change username by adding a 
random number as suffix. Random number is between 1 to 999. Ex: if user registers
with demo$demo@example.com, and username demodemo already exists, its username
would be demodemo_546.
